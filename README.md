## Description
Epidemiological Data from the nCoV-2019 Outbreak: Early Descriptions from Publicly Available Data
## Purpose 
The Data was used to participate in a Kaggle Competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/codiv19-motrality-risk/ where my team had to predict whether a patient with a number of features would die from covid19.  
Our goal was to provide public health decisionmakers with the valuable information about the mortality rate (the probability of death) of an incoming patient who is just admitted to the hospital. Knowing this information in advance can help decision-makers get ready for the worst, and prepare ventilators and critical care units for patients that are more likely to get sever conditions and potentially die.
